Repository is for R Code used in Time Series Analysis

Multivariate:
This repository contains multivariate time series exploratory data analysis on client data to create sales plots for hundreds of different indicators mapped to different sub end user markets 
on a monthly and quarterly frequency as well as utilizng multivariate Arima modeling on single indicators based on importance and multiple indicators where we take the top
4 indicators and the highest correlated indicators and conduct Arima modeling to identify the most important, least important, and not important indicators on a .5 p value
threshold
