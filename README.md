# Time-Series-R-Code-Analysis
Repository is for R Code used in Time Series Analysis

Multivariate
This repository contains multivariate time series exploratory data analysis on client data to create sales plots for hundreds of different indicators mapped to different sub end user markets 
on a monthly and quarterly frequency as well as utilizng multivariate Arima modeling on single indicators based on importance and multiple indicators where we take the top
4 indicators and the highest correlated indicators and conduct Arima modeling to identify the most important, least important, and not important indicators on a .5 p value
threshold

Univariate
Also there is a Univariate project on client data where I took the ast seales of the companies Revenue and Order Intake data and predicted the future values with machine learning algorithims and time series models
